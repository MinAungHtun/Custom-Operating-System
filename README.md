# MyyOS
The OS is referenced from tutorials and different documents across the internet that I followed while studying Operating system and computer system engineering.
I am very reluctant to change a lot of the modules and functions from the widely and commonly used ones (unless I've researched enough) as I didn't want the code to have any unwanted or unprecedented effects on the hardware.
On this public repository, the variable names, module names, modules used from libraries, data flows and structures are commonly known ones as I don't want experimental codes to be running on and harming machines.
You need to add hashing algorithms.
A disc image must have to produced from the source code as this is an OS but the old disc image is added as a reference on how the operating system might look like.
